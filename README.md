# hello-world
I'm learning GitHub for the first time, so hello-world is my first attempt at getting the hang of how things work.
I am a hard worker, and I'm very excited to learn how to code. I've always wanted to try, because I get this sense of mystery and accomplishment from it. The way it is portrayed in movies, and even here at UA, has made me realize just how exciting, yet challenging it can be.
