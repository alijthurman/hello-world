# hello-world
I'm learning GitHub for the first time, so hello-world is my first attempt at getting the hang of how things work.
I am a hard worker, and I'm very excited to learn how to code. I've always wanted to try, because I get this sense of mystery and accomplishment from it. The way it is portrayed in movies, and even here at UA, has made me realize just how exciting, yet challenging it can be. 
I enjoy learning new things and eating. Dinner rolls are especially nice, but my favorite food is Cajun Chicken Pasta. I've never coded before, but I'm excited to learn all the same!
